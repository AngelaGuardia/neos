## Mod 3 Refactoring Workshop

### Background
Near Earth Objects is an educational command line tool that strives to interrupt the monotony of day to day living by allowing users to understand how close to extinction life on earth is at any given point in time. Every day thousands of NEOs (Near Earth Objects) i.e. comets, astroids, meteors pass by the earth at alarmingly close distances. One slight shift in the cosmos would cause these NEOs to crash into the earth, setting off a series of catastrophic events that would lead to the end of life as we know it (much like the fate of the dinosaurs). Now that we've discussed this, please take a moment to appreciate 3 small things in your life that you take for granted and assume will always be there...

### Instructions
Please follow these instructions for further enlightenment.
- Clone this repo
- Run `bundle install` to download and install all of the necessary dependencies
- This project uses NASA's Astroids - NeoWs API. Please signup for an API key [here](https://api.nasa.gov/)
- Once you have your api key, run `figaro install` and add your api_key to the `application.yml` located in the `config` folder. Please add your api key in the following format `nasa_api_key: <Your API KEY Goes Here>`
- This project uses minitest. You can run the tests with the following command `ruby near_earth_objects_test.rb`
- To use the command line tool run `ruby start.rb`. You will be prompted to enter a date. Enter the date in the following format `YYYY-MM-DD` i.e. `2019-03-30`. Once you hit enter you will see information about the objects that came near to the earth on that day.
